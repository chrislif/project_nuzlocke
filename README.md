TERRORBYTS -

Five years ago a meteor hit the Earth and brought with it a virus.
This virus from space quickly infected all life on Earth and brought
devestation to its inhabitants. The only way for life to survive was
to rapidly mutate as the virus was feeds on DNA. Because of this wild
animals started to change rapidly until they looked wildly different.
With this rapid change they also gained great power and nature reclaimed
much of the land than humanity stole from it. Many humans died from the
virus until a cure was found and as quickly as it came the virus died out.

Now the world is a wild place full of mysterious and powerful creatures.
Humanity strives to carve out where it can a place to live with varying
success but severly diminished, the virus killed over 75% of humans.

New technology was made and with it humans gained the ability to subjugate
the monsterous creatures that roamed the land. With this in hand people
began to seek out, create and train the strongest monsters as it became
aparent that not only would it bring safety but dominance over this new
world. Because of the fear they inspired and this new digital technology
the creatures were named Terrorbyts and for many they hold the key to new
horizons.
